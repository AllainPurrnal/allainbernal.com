# allainbernal.com

The primary goal for this website is to house my Software/Web Development Portfolio along side general information about who I am, my philosophy when it comes to development (and life), and anything else I find interesting. This website will be ever evolving, just like I am as a person. 

Every experience builds on to what makes me who I am.

## Website Concept

The main idea for this website is to keep things simple with the work presented speaking for itself. 

The user will be able to scroll/swipe up to traverse the page. Information is presented in small bites to ensure that the reader/visitor does not get confused with any section.

The goal is to keep the website uncluttered and clean while making navigation simple and intuitive.

## Current Wireframe (WIP)

**Welcome Section**
- The main idea or concept with the landing page is to keep it simple but to also show as much as possible about my work and my hobbies
- At first glance it will show my name in a subtle and modern font. Nothing too fancy that will take attention away from the background
- The background will have a rotating set of images of my previous works and hobbies
  - The background is currently set to random on each page refresh
- At the bottom of the background image, there will be an arrow with a subtle animation to tell visitors of the website to scroll down to continue to the home page
