The primary goal for this website is to house my Software/Web Development Portfolio along side general information about who I am, my philosophy when it comes to development (and life), and anything else I find interesting. This website will be ever evolving, just like I am as a person. 

Every experience builds on to what makes me who I am.

## Website Concept
The main concept for this website is for it to appear as if the website visitor is looking into a shadow box. A shadow box is an enclosed glass-front display case containing objects presented in a thematic grouping with artistic or personal significance. 

With this idea in mind, I will recreate the look of a shadow box; filling it with was is personally significant to me.

**Landing Page**
![landing page index](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25943488/51159026-e247bc80-183b-11e9-889d-c93e6fc6eec4.png)
- The main idea or concept with the landing page is to keep it simple but to also show as much as possible about my work and my hobbies
- At first glance it will show my name in a subtle and modern font. Nothing too fancy that will take attention away from the background
- The background will have a rotating set of images of my previous works and hobbies
- At the bottom of the background image, there will be an arrow with a subtle animation to tell visitors of the website to scroll down to continue to the home page
